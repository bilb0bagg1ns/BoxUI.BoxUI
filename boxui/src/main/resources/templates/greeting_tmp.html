<b>TCP Wrapper</b> is a host-based networking ACL system, used to filter network 
access to Internet Protocol servers on (Unix-like) operating systems such as 
Linux or BSD. It allows host or subnetwork IP addresses, names and/or ident 
query replies, to be used as tokens on which to filter for access control
purposes.

<p>
The tarball includes a library named libwrap that implements the actual 
functionality. Initially, only services that were spawned for each connection 
from a super-server (such as inetd) got wrapped, utilizing the tcpd program. 
However most common network service daemons today can be linked against libwrap 
directly. This is used by daemons that operate without being spawned from a 
super-server, or when a single process handles multiple connections.
Otherwise, only the first connection attempt would get checked against its ACLs.
